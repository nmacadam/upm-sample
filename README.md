### UPM Sample
Example setup for Unity package development.  Includes CI workflow from [How to Maintain UPM Package](https://medium.com/openupm/how-to-maintain-upm-package-part-1-7b4daf88d4c4) by [favoyang](https://github.com/favoyang).

The Unity package is at `Packages/com.company.package`.  You can develop directly out of the `Packages/com.company.package` folder, providing a better preview of how the package will behave when installed by an end-user.

This repository is designed to be a boilerplate for new packages.  Using the included *Package Wizard* window, you can quickly rename the package URL, assembly definitions, default namespaces, the package folder name, and the name field of the manifest all at once.
